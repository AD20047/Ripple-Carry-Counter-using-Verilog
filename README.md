# Ripple-Carry-Counter-using-Verilog

Here, I have developed a Verilog code for a 4-bit ripple carry counter. Although I have used VS code as the editor but the simulations have been conducted using EDA Playground.
The code ensures that the counter gets incremented correctly with each clock pulse and resets properly.
